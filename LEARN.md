I made this project with the intensions to learn C and low level programming in general and what better way to start then on a 20 year old system with less ram than anything else I own!

All joking aside I decided to work on the gameboy advance for a few reasons:

1. I think its cool
2. I will learn somthing
3. I will have fun

I think its important to have an interest in projects that you make aswell as learning somthing as you gain benifit and can stay motivated far easier.

If anyone wants to follow my footsteps in GBA development check out [gbadev.net](https://gbadev.net/) and their community.

As of writing this I'm still working on this project so if anyone reading this has suggestions please reach out! I'd like to know what I'm doing horibly wrong.

Thanks for reading & happy programming!
